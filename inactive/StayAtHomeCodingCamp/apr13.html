    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="question">Does training really start from scratch?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Yes, we try to operate the course with the minimum possible entry limit, which currently means the
          following:<br>
          <br>
          <strong>1.</strong> You have a computer with stable internet connection and microphone (web camera is nice
          to have, but not necessary)<br>
          <strong>2.</strong> You can speak English, at least at conversational level<br>
          <strong>3.</strong> You will be available for 3 weeks every weekday from 15:00 to 19:00.<br>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">Is it really free?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, our main goal with the course is to give as many people as possible the opportunity
          to try programming in the time of coronavirus pandemic, whether it be self-improvement or even the
          foundation of a new career.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">What if the participants can join only for a part of the 4 hours/day?</div>
        <div class="answer">On Material Review days it’s not a problem, because those days you only need to watch a (long) video, but on Workshop days you might miss teamwork if you’re not available between 15:00-19:00</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">Out of the 4 hours per day how many more hours will I need to spend on homework?</div>
        <div class="answer">It's worth dedicating to half-one hour a day for homework and practice.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">Are the training materials still available after the course for the participants?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes!</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">How will the course look like? Is it interactive, do we need microphone, headset or
          webcam?</div>
        <div class="answer">There will be interactive teamwork in the given time slots between 15:00 and 19:00, which
          requires at least one well-functioning microphone in addition to your computer. Webcam is not necessary to
          complete the course, but it can help you to get to know each other better during the project and it can also
          support the teamwork.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">What kind of laptop do I need for the course?</div>
        <div class="answer">This laptop would preferably have at least a dual core processor and 4 GB of memory. The
          operating system can be Microsoft Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. You can also work from desktop PC.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">Using a corporate laptop might have some limitations. In particular, what programs may
          be required to attend the training? Do I need to install any programs to my laptop?</div>
        <div class="answer">In the first week, you probably won't need anything other than the Discord desktop app,
          and later these interfaces will come in handy:<br>
          <br>
          Github: <strong><a href="http://desktop.github.com">desktop.github.com</a></strong><br>
          Editor: <strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">code.visualstudio.com</a></strong><br>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">Could you give us a little more information on the thematics? How complex projects will
          we work on? </div>
        <div class="answer">You're going to cover 4 topics on the first 2 weeks. For each topic first you can get the
          overall picture by participating in a Material Review. This is going to happen on YouTube Stream and a
          mentor is going to go through the necessary parts. After that you'll join your study group to solve the so
          called workshop exercises. Each group of students will have the opportunity to help each other and reach
          real solutions through teamwork. You can always ask questions and give feedback to the other. Since the
          training is completely from scratch, so we’ll really focus on the basics, there will be no frameworks, but
          at the end of the project you’ll need to have a deeper understanding of the basics of Javascript and jQuery.

      <li>
        <div class="question">Are there any exams at the end of the course?</div>
        <div class="answer">We are not planning to do that.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">Do you provide any certificate at the end of the course?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, at the end of the course you will be enriched with the first self-developed web
          application and lots of practical knowledge :)</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">Do you offer headhunting service after finishing the course?</div>
        <div class="answer">This 3-week course is rather designed to find out if programming is right for you as a
          career path. In such a short time, you will not be able to acquire the knowledge you need to find a job in
          the labor market. If you are already sure that you want to work in the IT field in the future, we recommend
          our Superintensive or Part-time course.</div>
